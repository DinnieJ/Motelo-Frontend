# COMPONENTS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

The components directory contains your Vue.js Components.

_Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge these components._


**The common components will be preload to Nuxt app with prefix 'base'**

Example: @/components/common/Navbar.vue => <base-navbar/>
